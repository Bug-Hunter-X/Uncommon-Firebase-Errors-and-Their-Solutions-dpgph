The Firebase SDK might throw an error if the project configuration is incorrect or if there's a network issue.  For example, if your `firebase.initializeApp()` call uses an invalid `apiKey`, `authDomain`, or other configuration parameter, you'll get an error.  Similarly, if your app is offline or can't reach the Firebase servers, you'll encounter an error. Another uncommon error occurs when dealing with asynchronous operations where error handling isn't implemented correctly. For instance, if you're reading data from the Realtime Database or Firestore, you must handle the `catch` block to deal with potential errors like network connectivity issues or permission errors.  Failure to implement proper error handling may lead to unexpected app behavior or crashes.
